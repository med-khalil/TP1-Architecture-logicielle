## Single Responsibility Principal -SRP
### Defintion

One class should serve only one purpose. When a class serves multiple purposes or responsibilities, it should be made into a new class.
### Exercise
#### How does the initial implementation violate the SRP
The initial CarManager class handle more than one role: 
1. it handle getting the car data from DB layer 
2. it handles how we format the car names
3. it handles how we compare different cars and get the best one

Since we can find more than one reason to change the CarManager class it clearly violate the SRP 
#### How did we fix it?
We extracted the 2 method reponsible for formatting the car names and companring between different cars into their own class (CarComparer and CarFormater and both depend on the carmanager)

## Open Close Principal -OCP
### Defintion
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Thepurpose of this principle is being able to extend a Classâ€™s behaviour withoutchanging the existing behaviour of that Class.
### Exercise

#### How does the initial implementation violate the OCP
#### How did we fix it?

## Liskov Substitution Principle -LSP
### Defintion
Any objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with an objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. 

That requires the objects of subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of the superclass.
### Exercise
#### How does the initial implementation violate the LSP
In the initial design ElectronicDuck did inherit formm Duck however the overiden method in the ElectronicDuck subclass (inherited from Duck) need specific logic that is only present inside the ElectronicDuck class to funtion (_on being set to true). 

This break the  LSP principal since we can't substitue Duck by ElectronicDuck inside the pool class without breaking our program

#### How did we fix it?
We made sure that the design respect the LSP principal by renaming Duck to LivingDuck and breaking the inheritance relationship between LivingDuck and ElectronicDuck (now both implement the interface IDuck without ElectronicDuck inheriting from Duck)
