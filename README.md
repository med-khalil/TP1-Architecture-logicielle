# TP1 SOLID Principals
## Single Responsibility Principal -SRP
### defintion

One class should serve only one purpose. When a class serves multiple purposes or responsibilities, it should be made into a new class.
### exercise
#### How does the initial implementation violate the SRP
The initial CarManager class handle more than one role: 
1- it handle getting the car data from DB layer 
2- it handles how we format the car names
3- it handles how we compare different cars and get the best one
Since we can find more than one reason to change the CarManager class it clearly violate the SRP 
#### How did we fix it
We extracted the 2 method reponsible for formatting the car names and companring between different cars into their own class (CarComparer and CarFormater and both depend on the carmanager)

## Open Close Principal -OCP
### defintion
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Thepurpose of this principle is being able to extend a Classâ€™s behaviour withoutchanging the existing behaviour of that Class.
